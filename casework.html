            <ul>
                <li><strong>In re Gold Medal Karate Inc. dba Zhang-Sah Martial Arts, FTC Report No. 178865987 (Oct. 11, 2024)</strong>, involving allegations of labor law violations, financial mismanagement, and misuse of nonprofit funds under the direction of Salvatore J.

Sandone, President of Brave Scholar Inc., involving the misappropriation of nonprofit public funds under the guise of a fraudulent licensing agreement. Between May 2022 and September 2023, over $142,800 was transferred from Gold Medal Karate Inc. to Brave Scholar Inc. for supposed "curriculum technology" licenses, despite no discernible benefit to the nonprofit. These transfers occurred while Gold Medal Karate Inc. was simultaneously experiencing wage delays, leaving employees unpaid for multiple pay periods.</li>
                <li><strong>In re PA Dems, FTC Report No. 178567437 (Oct. 7, 2024)</strong>, involving an unsolicited political text message encouraging immediate action on a mail-in ballot, raising concerns under the FTC’s unsolicited communication and political pressure practices jurisdiction.</li>
                <li><strong>In re PA Turnpike, FTC Report No. 178640885 (Oct. 7, 2024)</strong>, involving a phishing scam that falsely claimed an outstanding toll balance, with a fabricated threat of late fees, raising concerns under the FTC's deceptive practices jurisdiction.</li>

                <li><strong>In re Henry Jones, FTC Report No. 177789856 (Sept. 17, 2024)</strong>, addressing a sextortion scam email that demanded $1,300 in cryptocurrency, representing a violation of consumer protection laws.</li>
                <li><strong>In re Adecco Recruitment, FTC Report No. 177174559 (Sept. 1, 2024)</strong>, involving a suspected fraudulent job offer delivered via unsolicited text message, raising concerns under the FTC’s deceptive practices jurisdiction.</li>
                <li><strong>Jamasbi v. Gold Medal Karate Inc. dba Zhang-Sah Martial Arts, No. 2024018904-RO (Pa. UCBR 2024)</strong>, establishes a significant precedent in nonprofit wage law, affirming that employees are protected against erratic wage payments. The case involved Kian Jamasbi, who voluntarily resigned from his position as Vice President of Finance at Gold Medal Karate after experiencing repeated delays in his pay. Despite raising concerns about the late payments with his employer, who attributed the delays to issues with funders, the problem persisted throughout several pay periods in July, August, and October 2023. The Appeals Referee credited Jamasbi’s testimony and found that his resignation was justified under Pennsylvania law, citing a necessitous and compelling reason for quitting due to wage instability. The Referee also referenced Pennsylvania courts’ stance that employees are not required to continually complain about delayed wages to qualify for unemployment compensation, especially when payments are intermittently late, which violates the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law. As a result, Jamasbi was granted unemployment benefits under Section 402(b) of the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law, with the ruling affirming the unacceptable nature of inconsistent wage payments in the nonprofit sector and providing a precedent for other workers facing similar circumstances.</li>
                <li><strong>In re Gold Medal Karate Inc. dba Zhang-Sah Martial Arts, No. BCP-24-05-003960 (Pa. Bureau of Consumer Protection, Office of the Attorney General, Feb. 6, 2024)</strong>, involving the unauthorized use of a former employee's work email and identity following their departure from the company, in violation of consumer protection statutes. On June 18, 2024, the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Bureau of Consumer Protection sent a formal letter informing me that the mediation process had reached an impasse. While the case file will remain open for potential future action, the Bureau has closed active mediation efforts. The ongoing recommendation is for me to pursue private legal action against Gold Medal Karate Inc. by filing a lawsuit in Magisterial District Court.</li>
                <li><strong>In re Gold Medal Karate Inc. dba Zhang-Sah Martial Arts, No. 2024-00130 (Pa. Dep't of Labor & Indus., Bureau of Labor Law Compliance Jan. 30, 2024)</strong>, addressing a wage claim for $3,200 against Gold Medal Karate for failure to pay legally entitled wages, implicating violations of Pennsylvania’s Wage Payment and Collection Law. On January 30, 2024, the Bureau of Labor Law Compliance issued a formal letter stating that they were unable to resolve the wage claim against Gold Medal Karate and had closed the investigation. The decision was made without an assessment of the merits of the case.</li>
