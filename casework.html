        <strong>In re Gold Medal Karate Inc. dba Zhang-Sah Martial Arts, No. 2024-00130 (Pa. Dep't of Labor & Indus., Bureau of Labor Law Compliance, Jan. 8, 2024)</strong>,

    <div style="border-bottom: 1px solid #000; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;">
        The Bureau of Labor Law Compliance closed its investigation on January 30, 2024, without addressing the claim’s merits. However, on October 16, 2024, 
        the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Charitable Trusts and Organizations Section assumed control of the matter as part of a larger probe into 
        the activities of Salvatore Sandone.

        <strong>Jamasbi v. Gold Medal Karate Inc. dba Zhang-Sah Martial Arts, No. 2024018904-RO (Pa. UCBR, Nov. 12, 2023)</strong>, 
        establishes that employees are protected from erratic wage payments. The case centered on the Vice President of Finance, 
        who resigned following repeated delays in pay despite raising concerns with his employer. These delays affected multiple pay 
        periods in July, August, and October 2023, with CEO Salvatore Sandone attributing the disruptions to issues with funders.

    <div style="border-bottom: 1px solid #000; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;">
        On November 12, 2023, the employee filed a claim for qualifying separation with the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry. 
        On January 17, 2024, the Erie UC Service Center concluded that the circumstances justified the resignation and awarded unemployment 
        benefits. Zhang-Sah Martial Arts appealed the decision on February 5, 2024, leading to a hearing on May 15, 2024, at the Philadelphia 
        Referee Office, attended by Sandone and Domonique Pagan on behalf of the employer.

        On August 14, 2024, Referee Robert Bates affirmed the UC Service Center’s decision, awarding Jamasbi $15,730.00 in unemployment 
        compensation benefits, effective October 26, 2023. The deadline to appeal this ruling was September 4, 2024. Since no appeal was 
        filed, Referee Bates' decision remains final.
