                    <li><strong>In re Goldman Sachs Bank USA, CFPB Complaint No. 241025-16669227 (Oct. 25, 2024)</strong>, concerns Goldman Sachs’ blocking of over $5,100 in an Apple Savings Account, including the denial of multiple withdrawal requests, such as a nominal $1.00 attempt. The complainant, after multiple failed access attempts, incurred financial penalties, including interest charges, late fees, and credit score damage. Goldman Sachs cited unspecified "security concerns" but did not clarify or substantiate these claims. Following the complainant's feedback rejecting Goldman’s response, the CFPB closed the complaint, adding it to the Consumer Complaint Database and notifying the FTC.</li>

                    <li><strong>Jamasbi v. Gold Medal Karate Inc. d/b/a Zhang-Sah Martial Arts, No. 2024018904-RO (Pa. UC, Aug 14, 2024)</strong>, holds that employees are entitled to unemployment benefits when wage payments are repeatedly delayed without resolution. The Vice President of Finance resigned after experiencing multiple pay disruptions in July, August, and October 2023, despite raising concerns with CEO Salvatore Sandone, who attributed the delays to funding issues. Jamasbi filed for unemployment on November 12, 2023, and the Erie UC Service Center ruled in his favor on January 17, 2024, finding the resignation justified. Zhang-Sah Martial Arts appealed, and a hearing was held on May 15, 2024, where both Sandone and Vice President of Operations Domonique Pagan testified. Referee Robert Bates affirmed the decision on August 14, 2024, awarding Jamasbi $15,730 in benefits. The appeal deadline expired on September 4, 2024, leaving the decision final and unchallenged.</li>
