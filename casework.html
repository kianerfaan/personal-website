        <strong>Jamasbi v. Gold Medal Karate Inc. dba Zhang-Sah Martial Arts, No. 2024018904-RO (Pa. UCBR, November 12, 2024)</strong> 
        affirms that employees are protected against erratic wage payments. The case involved the Vice President of Finance at 
        Gold Medal Karate, who resigned after experiencing repeated delays in pay. Despite raising concerns about the late payments 
        with his employer, the issue persisted across multiple pay periods in July, August, and October 2023. CEO Salvatore Sandone 
        attributed the delays to problems with funders.

        On January 17, 2024, the Erie UC Service Center determined that the circumstances warranted the employee's separation 
        from the company. Zhang-Sah Martial Arts filed an appeal on February 5, 2024. A hearing was held on May 15, 2024, at the 
        Philadelphia Referee Office, attended by Salvatore Sandone and Domonique Pagan on behalf of Gold Medal Karate Inc. On 
        August 14, 2024, Referee Robert Bates affirmed the UC Service Center’s determination, granting Jamasbi $15,730.00 in 
        unemployment compensation benefits, effective October 26, 2023. The deadline to appeal this decision was September 4, 2024. 
        Since no appeal was filed, Referee Robert Bates' decision stands.
