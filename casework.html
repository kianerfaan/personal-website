        <strong>Jamasbi v. Gold Medal Karate Inc. d/b/a Zhang-Sah Martial Arts, No. 2024018904-RO (Pa. UCBR, Aug. 14, 2024))</strong>, 
        holds that employees are entitled to unemployment benefits when wage payments are repeatedly delayed without resolution. The Vice President of Finance resigned after experiencing multiple pay disruptions in July, August, and October 2023, despite raising concerns with CEO Salvatore Sandone, who attributed the delays to funding issues. Jamasbi filed for unemployment on November 12, 2023, and the Erie UC Service Center ruled in his favor on January 17, 2024, finding the resignation justified by the circumstances. Zhang-Sah Martial Arts appealed, but after a May 15, 2024, hearing attended by Sandone and Domonique Pagan, Referee Robert Bates affirmed the decision on August 14, 2024, awarding $15,730.00 in benefits. The deadline to appeal lapsed on September 4, 2024, leaving the referee’s decision final and unchallenged.
