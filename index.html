            <h2>A Brief Introduction to a Theory of Everything</h2>
            <p><strong>May 1, 2017 - Ft. Washington, Pennsylvania</strong></p>
            <div class="content-buffer">
                <p>A Theory of Everything (TOE) is a term for a hypothetical single, coherent framework of physics that fully explains all physical aspects of the universe. Starting from the time of Isaac Newtown, physicists have been able to verify the existence of four fundamental physical forces in the universe: gravity, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. The notion that all four fundamental forces are somehow deeply unified resulted in the pursuit for a ToE. A large aim of physics now is to produce theories that unify these forces, ultimately showing that there is a base of only one fundamental force in the universe, which has come to display itself as if it were many different forces. In the pursuit of understanding these fundamental forces, Isaac Newton's and Albert Einstein's theories have improved the understanding of gravitation and spacetime. James Clerk Maxwell's Equations are now taken as axioms in electromagnetic field theory, reducing electric and magnetic forces into one and the same. More recently, the electromagnetic force with the strong nuclear force have been proposed through the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) but lack corroboration. The Theory of Everything will have to find a way to unify the Grand Unifying Theory with Einstein's General Relativity, which discusses the nature of gravity.</p>
                <h3>Gravity</h3>
                <p>Gravity, one of the four fundamental forces, has only recently been reduced to a single framework. Beginning with Galileo Galilei, terrestrial mechanics and gravity were observed and measured. In addition to working with terrestrial mechanics, Galileo corroborated claims made by Copernicus regarding the heliocentric model of the solar system. Similar to Galileo's terrestrial mechanics pursuits, Johannes Kepler sought to explain celestial mechanics through his three laws of planetary motion. Kepler's three laws of planetary motion are the foundation stones of Newtonian synthesis. Following Isaac Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation, all planetary motions could be explained through two simple equations: Newton's second law and the universal law of gravitational force inversely proportional to the square of the distance. The Newtonian synthesis is the model for the reductionist approach to physics to explain all phenomena as based on fundamental sets of interactions.</p>
                <p>While Newton's synthesis of gravity is considered the first great unification of physics, Albert Einstein's Theory of General Relativity is considered the third, with Maxwell's Equations being the second. Einstein's Theory of General Relativity represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of gravity. Rather than describing gravity as a force, as Newton did, General Relativity describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime itself. In this theory, massive objects warp the fabric of spacetime, and what we perceive as gravitational attraction is actually the result of objects following the curvature of this warped spacetime.</p>
                <p>These relationships can be seen in Einstein's Field Equations, a set of 10 equations that describe the fundamental interactions of gravity. In this theory, objects are no longer coupled to a gravitational field, instead they merely exist in spacetime. While Newtonian theory of gravitation has two distinct entities, the General Theory has one: curved spacetime. Through Einstein's theory of General Relativity, gravitation can be explained cohesively through a single framework of curved spacetime.</p>
                <h3>Electromagnetism</h3>
                <p>The second fundamental force after gravity is electromagnetism. In electromagnetism, Maxwell's equations are the foundation of the reduction of the electric and magnetic forces into a sole relationship. Maxwell's equations have been considered to be the most important aggregation of empirical facts in the history of physics due to its ability to explain interactions between light, electricity, and magnetism. James Clark Maxwell was able to formulate four equations from the experimental observations of many scientists at the time, most notably Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, Hans Christian Orsted, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Jean-Baptiste Biot, Felix Savart, Andrew Marie Ampere, and Michael Faraday. Maxwell's four equations provide for a coherent understanding of the electromagnetic force and are considered by many to be the second greatest unification of physics following Isaac Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation.</p>
                <p>The first of Maxwell's Equations, known as Gauss' Law for Magnetism, states that one can compute the total charge inside a closed surface by integrating the normal component of the electric field over the surface. The second equation, known as Gauss' Law, states that there are no magnetic monopoles. The third equation, known as Faraday's Law, indicates that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field. Finally, the fourth equation, known as Ampere's law, states that currents and changing electric fields produce magnetic fields. Faraday's Law (Equation 3) is a consequence of Gauss' Law for Magnetism (Equation 1) while Ampere's Law (Equation 4) is a consequence of Gauss' Law (Equation 2).</p>
                <h3>Weak Nuclear Force</h3>
                <p>The third fundamental force of nature is the weak force, or the weak nuclear force. The weak nuclear force is responsible for the radioactive decay of subatomic particles and plays an essential role in nuclear fission. Weak nuclear force is sometimes explained under quantum flavordynamics (QFD). In 1933, Enrico Fermi first introduced the weak nuclear force through his theory known as Fermi's Interaction. Fermi suggested that beta decay could be modeled by a four-fermion interaction. Most notably, the weak nuclear force is responsible for the changing of the flavor of quarks and is propagated by force carrier particles that have significant masses, which can be furthered explained in the Standard Model. While the weak nuclear force was known for the majority of the 20th century, it was not until the unification of the electromagnetic force and the weak force into the electroweak force did the force become more effectively understood. The best explanation of the interactions provided by the weak nuclear force can be understood in terms of the electroweak theory and the Standard Model of particle physics.</p>
                <h3>Strong Nuclear Force</h3>
                <p>The fourth and final fundamental force of nature comes from the strong nuclear force. The strong nuclear force is approximately one hundred times stronger than electromagnetism, one million stronger than the weak nuclear force, and 10^38 times stronger than gravitation. The strong nuclear force provides for a better understanding regarding the stability of ordinary matter and hadron particles, such as the proton and neutron. The nuclear force, also known as the residual strong force, has been found in the context of binding protons and neutrons to form atomic nuclei. The binding energy that is partly released on the breakup of a nucleus is related to the residual strong force and can be harnessed in nuclear power. The strong force is hypothesized to be transferred through massless particles called gluons, that are exchanged between quarks, antiquarks, and other gluons. The theory of the strong nuclear force, called quantum chromodynamics (QCD), describes the interactions between quarks and gluons which make up hadrons, a group of particles that include protons and neutrons. The theory is critical to the Standard Model and a large body of experimental evidence for QCD has been collected in recent decades.</p>
                <h3>Electroweak Unification</h3>
                <p>Arguably, the fourth greatest unification of physics has come with the unification of the electromagnetic force with the weak nuclear force in the 1970s. Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for their contribution to the electroweak interaction theory. The discovery of neutral currents in neutrinos, subatomic particles produced by the decay of radioactive elements that lack an electric charge, in 1973 and the discovery of the W and Z gauge bosons, force carriers, in protons in 1983 provided evidence that the electromagnetic and weak nuclear force were two different aspects of the same force, despite appearing very differently at low energies. In 1999, Gerardus Hooft and Martinus Veltman were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for showing that the electroweak theory is renormalizable, thus further substantiating the theory. Throughout the 21st century, the electroweak force has been regarded as the first unification between two of the four fundamental forces of nature.</p>
                <h3>The Standard Model</h3>
                <p>The Standard Model of particle physics is a cohesive theory regarding the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear forces in addition to the classification of all known subatomic particles. The Standard Model, as known as the "Theory of Almost Everything", was finalized during the 1970s through experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. Since then, the discovery of the top quark in 1995, the tau neutrino in 2000, and the Higgs boson in 2012, the Standard Model has endured a variety of successes. Although the Standard Model is believed to be successful in providing experimental predictions, it fails to incorporate gravity and neutrino oscillations. The Standard Model is the paradigm of quantum field theory and is attempting to be incorporated in an all-encompassing Grand Unifying Theory.</p>
                <h3>Grand Unifying Theory</h3>
                <p>A Grand Unifying Theory (GUT) is a model of particle physics in which the three fundamental forces of the Standard Model (electromagnetism, weak, and strong nuclear force) are unified into a single force. While the Standard Model has enjoyed successes, it fails to incorporate neutrino oscillations, phenomena in which neutrinos created with a particular flavor is later measured to be of a different flavor, and is unable to provide a cohesive framework of understanding the three forces. A GUT will be able to unify the electroweak force with the strong nuclear force. Several models of a GUT exist, but they often introduce additional fields and interactions that often lead to complexity and difficulties. Due to these difficulties, there are no observed effects of a grand unification so far, resulting in a lack of an accepted GUT model. If a Grand Unifying Theory is achieved, unifying it with gravity will introduce a single framework of physics detailing the interactions of nature, hence the Theory of Everything.</p>
                <h3>Quantum Gravity</h3>
                <p>Quantum Gravity (QG) is a field of theoretical physics that seeks to understand gravity through quantum mechanics. Currently, gravity is best understood from Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. With the exception of gravity, all the fundamental forces of nature can be described through quantum mechanics. The need for understanding gravitation through quantum mechanics comes from the pursuit of coupling classical physics with quantum physics. Quantum gravity will provide a foundation for the unification of gravity with the other three fundamental forces of nature. The discovery of the graviton, a hypothetical massless particle that mediates the gravitational force through quantum mechanics, could potentially provide a framework in which gravity is able to be coupled with the other three fundamental forces. Some quantum gravity theories such as string theory also attempt to unify the four forces together, while other theories such as loop quantum gravity make no attempt. While there are various theories regarding quantum gravity, there is currently no generally accepted framework that is able to describe gravity through quantum mechanics. The quantum gravitational effects are expected, however, to be apparent with far larger energies than what is currently accessible.</p>
                <h3>A Theory of Everything</h3>
                <p>Discovering a single, cohesive framework detailing the interactions of the four fundamental forces of the universe is one of the major unsolved problems in physics. Currently, Einstein’s General Relativity provides a detailed understanding of gravity and spacetime as a whole. While gravitation, the foundation for classical physics, has been unified, quantum mechanics involving the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces have not been. The Standard Model and the Grand Unified Theory have presented various frameworks in which unification could potentially be achieved. In order to provide experimentally acquired observations, higher energies similar to the early stages of the universe must be able to be simulated in an experimental setting. While the unification of the electromagnetic force and the nuclear weak force has been corroborated with observations made during the second half of the 20th century, other unification energies exceed current experimental settings. Quantum Gravity attempts to detail gravity through quantum mechanics in pursuit of unifying it with the Grand Unifying Theory.</p>
