            <h2>WL Alpha Launch: Modernizing International Arbitration</h2>
            <p><strong>October 31, 2024 - New York City, New York</strong></p>
            <div class="content-buffer">
                <p>I am pleased to announce the soft launch of WL Alpha, now accessible at <a href="https://worldlaw.ai" target="_blank">worldlaw.ai</a>. As the co-founder of WorldLaw LLC with my longtime friend Marc (@marcsivan), I am excited to share our first steps as a company.</p>
                
                <h4>Modernizing International Arbitration</h4>
                <p>WorldLaw LLC was incorporated on September 16, 2024, in Erie, PA, but our journey began much earlier. Marc and I have been friends since elementary school. I bring a background in economics from the University of Michigan and ongoing studies at Fordham Law, while Marc contributes extensive expertise in software development and AI, holding both a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Drexel University. Together, we believe our blend of legal and technical skills provides a foundation for a robust, innovative company.</p>
                
                <p>Platforms like Jus Mundi have set the standard in international legal research and arbitration with comprehensive databases and AI tools. However, WorldLaw's vision goes further: we will reimagine the entire workflow of international arbitration from the ground up. WL Alpha will address the real-world challenges practitioners face daily: coordinating across time zones, managing deadlines, organizing virtual hearings, handling document submissions, and ensuring compliance across jurisdictions.</p>
                
                <h4>Today's Launch: A Starting Point</h4>
                <p>Today’s soft launch introduces an early prototype, a proof of concept. In November, we will introduce a subscription model at $12/month with a 3-day free trial. Adopting an iterative approach, we will rely on user feedback to refine the platform, making sure it meets the needs of international legal professionals.</p>
                
                <h4>Building Beyond Information Access</h4>
                <p>We are focused on building a company that actively assists with international arbitration management. Our goal is not merely to build another search tool but to create an intelligent platform that understands the complexities of international commercial arbitration, helping practitioners work more efficiently across borders. Our vision for WorldLaw even extends to emerging frontiers, including commerce in cyberspace and outer space!</p>
                
                <h4>Join Us on This Journey</h4>
                <p>Currently, we are building a community around WL Alpha. As two founders with full-time commitments, Marc and I are developing WL Alpha on evenings and weekends, a passion project we are committed to growing into a platform.</p>
                
                <p>Today’s release is a modest start with substantial potential. Based at 502 W 7th St, Ste 100, Erie, PA, we invite early adopters to join us at <a href="https://worldlaw.ai" target="_blank">worldlaw.ai</a>, follow @worldlaw_ai for updates, or reach out at contact@worldlaw.ai with feedback.</p>
