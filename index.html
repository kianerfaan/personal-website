            <h2>Statement on the Brazil-China Peace Initiative for Ukraine and Global Nuclear Security</h2>
            <p><strong>September 18, 2024 - New York City, New York</strong></p>
            <p>As the war in Ukraine continues, the need for a diplomatic solution becomes more urgent by the day. The conflict has already caused immense suffering, but its impact goes beyond Ukraine’s borders. The world is facing rising food insecurity, energy instability, and the looming threat of nuclear escalation. It is essential that we act now to prevent further destruction.</p>
            <p>The <em>Common Understandings Between China and Brazil on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis</em> offers a promising path forward. Developed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, this peace initiative addresses the core issues driving the conflict. Most importantly, it directly confronts the nuclear threat that has overshadowed the war since it began.</p>
            <p>The plan’s emphasis on nuclear non-proliferation is significant, especially given how close Ukraine’s nuclear facilities are to active fighting. The Brazil-China initiative prohibits attacks on nuclear power plants and the use of nuclear weapons, making it one of the few proposals that prioritizes this issue. This focus on nuclear safety should rally global support, including from the United States and other world powers.</p>

            <p>Encouragingly, this initiative has already received positive international responses. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has praised the proposal as a balanced approach that could help de-escalate the situation. Regional powers, like Kazakhstan and Iran, have also expressed their support, further highlighting the momentum behind a political settlement.</p>
            <p>However, the Brazil-China plan is not without its challenges. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has raised concerns about its handling of territorial disputes. These are legitimate concerns, but instead of dismissing the proposal, the international community should engage with it to address these issues and ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty is protected.</p>
            
            <p>Prominent voices like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Donald Trump Jr. have already warned of the risks of further escalation. In their joint letter published in September 2024, they stressed that "there is no remaining step between firing U.S. missiles deep into Russian territory and a nuclear exchange." Their warning makes it clear how necessary diplomatic action is right now.</p>
            <p>As a global leader, the United States should support the Brazil-China peace initiative. With backing from important actors, U.S. involvement could help strengthen the plan to ensure it leads to a lasting peace. By lending its diplomatic influence, the U.S. can help shape a plan that includes enforceable ceasefire conditions, accountability for war crimes, and a path to restoring Ukraine’s sovereignty.</p>
            <p>We are at a crucial point. The world cannot afford to ignore this opportunity, nor can it allow the war in Ukraine to continue unchecked. The risks are simply too high. Now is the time for the world to unite in pursuit of peace.</p>
