            <h2>The Ideologue Behind the Iranian Revolution</h2>
            <p><strong>October 1, 2024 - New York City, New York</strong></p>
            <div class="content-buffer">
                <p>Foreword: Sooner Than People Think</p>
                </p>In June 2015, as a 16-year-old student at Germantown Academy in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, I wrote The Ideologue Behind the Iranian Revolution. At the time, I was exploring the history of Iran and the figures who shaped its political landscape. Today, as I revisit this work, I publish it here in its unchanged, original form.</p>
                </p>The article examines the aftermath of the 1953 U.S. and British-backed coup that ousted Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh and cemented the Shah's rule. This event left a deep legacy of mistrust toward Western interference, a sentiment that still resonates in Iran today. The 1979 revolution, led by figures such as Ayatollah Khomeini, Massoud Rajavi, and Ali Shariati, transformed the Imperial State of Iran, under a Persian monarchy, into an Islamic Republic. My focus was on exploring the intellectual and religious forces that drove this transformation.</p>
                </p>A significant dynamic of the revolution was the unlikely alliance between secular leftists, represented by the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), and religious clerics under Khomeini. This was also known as the alliance between the Red (communism) and the Black (Islamism). Despite ideological contradictions, this coalition toppled the Persian monarchy. Over time, the MEK has become a controversial group with diminished domestic influence, operating primarily in exile under the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). In contrast, Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah, leads the National Council of Iran (NCI), advocating for a secular, democratic Iran with support from parts of the Iranian diaspora.</p>  
                </p>Today, the MEK’s NCRI and Reza Pahlavi’s NCI represent two distinct opposition visions for Iran’s future, both challenging the clerical regime that has ruled since 1979.</p>
                </p>Recent events underscore the ongoing volatility of Iran’s political landscape. The Islamic Republic’s missile attacks on Israel in April and October 2024 signal serious strategic miscalculations and suggest that change may happen sooner than people think. The April strike, involving over 300 drones and missiles, marked an unprecedented direct assault from Iranian soil. A similar mistake in October, with over 180 ballistic missiles launched, has recklessly exposed Iranian civilians to the threat of retaliation.</p>
                </p>As you read this article, originally written in my teenage years, consider its historical context and the lasting impact recent events might have on Iran’s future. Thank you.</p>

              <p>   June 1, 2015 - Ft. Washington, Pennsylvania <p>
              <p>   Following the expulsion of a popular democratic leader, Mohammad Mosaddeq, by the CIA and MI6 in 1953, Iran faced over two and half decades of political instability and social movements that threatened the Shah's rule. Reza Shah Pahlavi was inserted into power by foreign powers in order to protect Western possession of Iran's large oil reserves. The Shah opposed religion and sought to transform Iran into a secular, modern nation. His radical, quick reforms angered much of Iran's rural populations where the shi'a clerics provided much of the local leadership. After the Shah had declared the White Revolution of Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini assembled the leaders of the shi'a ulama, or clergy, and officially denounced the Shah. Khomeini was exiled into Iraq by the Shah following his failed usurpation of the government. In addition to Khomeini protesting the Shah's government, Massoud Rajavi, a secular scholar, became incarcerated by the Shah in the 70s due to his opposition to the regime. Both Khomeini and Rajavi failed to independently topple the Shah. Ali Shariati however, was an example of how a secular intellectual sparked support for the Ayatollahs and religious movements in Iran. Although Sharati was assassinated by Shah's secret police, the SAVAKA, he became a martyr to professors and students all across Iran who shifted their support for those Sharati favored, the Ayatollahs. Ali Shariati, a popular secular intellectual, provided the atmosphere for religious clerics, such as Ayatollah Khomeini, to gain the necessary support from universities and its students during the Iranian Revolution of 1979. <p>
              <p>   Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini was born on September 22nd, 1902 in Markazi Province, Iran. Following World War I, he studied Islam under Ayatollah Abdul Karim haeri Yazdi in Arak, Iran. Khomeini's studies included Greek philosophy as well, particularly Aristotle and Plato. After decades of Islamic studies, Khomeini became a marja' in 1963, earning him the title of Grand Ayatollah. By the mid 1960s, Khomeini had established himself as a popular cleric and leader in the strengthening Iranian Shi'a clergy. In January 1963, Reza Shah Pahlavi instituted the White Revolution, a series of radical reformed which frustrated and instigated retaliation from the Iranian ulama. The reforms included ending feudalism, nationalization of forests, free compulsory education, introduction of social security, and woman suffrage. With the introduction of these reforms, Iran seemed to be on the path of Westernization. However, these reforms angered Ayatollah Khomeini, a strict religious conservative. Many of the clerics were large landowners who were also angered by their confiscated lands. Khomeini was arrested in Qom for denouncing the Shah and later transferred to Tehran soon afterwards. He was quickly released due to protests. However, he was again arrested in November 1964. When refusing to drop his opposition to the government, Prime Minister Hasan Ali Mansur slapped Khomeini's face. Two weeks later, Mansur was assassinated by members of an Islamic terrorist group which supported Khomeini. To prevent allowing Khomeini becoming a martyr, he was sent to exile in Najaf, Iraq. After fourteen long years in Iraq, Vice President Saddam Hussein at the time, encouraged him to leave for Paris, France. Khomeini, after decades of religious studies and support by hundreds of thousands failed to topple the government in the 60s. Khomeini strictly advocated for religion and failed to persuade the students and intellectuals of the urban populations. He lacked support from the youth and educated intellectuals which supported the secular, westernizing policies of the Shah. To them, Islam was a religion of restriction that prevented the natural growth of the nation. It wasn't until the late 70s when intellectuals and youths supported the Ayatollah, that the Shah's regime would collapse. By then, Khomeini was followed by millions, including intellectuals and the majority of the students in Iran. Without the support of the intellectuals and urban populations of Iran, Grand Ayatollah Khomeini's attempt at overthrowing the regime of the Shah failed, quickly, as a result of him being exiled to Iraq for over 14 years. <p>
              <p>   Although Khomeini's attempt was the most prominent, students followed by intellectuals contributed to the social unrest in Iran under the Shah independently from the Shi'a clergy. Massoud Rajavi was born in 1948 in Tabas, Iran. He earned a political law degree from Tehran University and quickly became a known scholar. While studying at Tehran University, him along with five other students, formed the Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organization (MEK) in 1965. Over the next several years, focus of the group was on ideological organization. Although the Islamic Marxist group would later split among Islamic and Marxist principles, at the time, moderate interpretation of Islam allowed for Marxist support to grow under the group. Rajavi was not a practicing religious man, however he led the Mujahedins. This was a result of his understanding of how a moderate interpretation of Islam could benefit the Iranian society as a whole. By 1970, anger against the Shah was rising and increasing support for the Mujahedin advocated for an aggressive response from them. Following two failed assassinations, by 1975, over ten major American-owned buildings were bombed and six Americans were assassinated by the Peykar, a Marxist ideological split faction of the group that solely advocated for Marxism and violence. The MEK, led under Rajavi denied involvement in the assassinations and the growing violence. However, he was arrested in 1971 and sentenced to death by the SAVAK. His sentence was later reduced to life in prison as a result of his esteemed brother who was a human rights activist. Although he was later released in 1979 as a result of the collapse of the Shah's regime, his political party's attempt to topple the Shah failed with his arrest. Massoud Rajavi led the MEK through moderate interpretations of Islam and connected it with the social structure of the time. He strongly opposed the power of the clergy of Iran and was predominantly popular among students, the youth, and other intellectuals. Rajavi's writings address and support many different pseudo-scientific theories, such as intelligent design, through verses in the Qur'ran. Although this angered many clerics, students and intellectuals favorably viewed him. Massoud Rajavi, an intellectual scholar, used the MEK as a platform to manifest his agenda and pursue this goal of toppling the regime. However, without the support of the powerful, influential Ayatollahs of Iran, his attempt to remove the Shah was also ineffective. <p>
               <p>  Lack of cooperation between the clerics and the intellectuals of Iran stemmed from lack of incentive to. Ali Shariati was born in 1933 in Kahak, Iran. His writings and lectures would persuade millions to support the clerics, such as Ayatollah Khomeini. In 1958 Shariati became enrolled in Mashhad University and studied for his masters degree in foreign languages, specializing in Arabic as well as French. After earning a scholarship, he studied for his Ph.D in sociology ar Sorbonne University in Paris. While in France, he became the editor of two academic journals: Iran Azad and the Iranian Student Confederation. During his studies, he became a proactive reader of contemporary radicals. This included his mentor Jean-Paul Sartre. As a result of his studies in France, Shariati concluded that in order to fight Western Imperialism, a nation such as Iran, must first regain their cultural identity. Although he was not personally religious, he understood the value of religion. When criticized for this, he says, "university intellectuals accuse me of being religious and religious figures accuse me of attacking their religion...the fact is that I am neither, but I understand both and I believe both sides understand my message". His work, which included scholarly interpretations of Islamic text, became controversial among clerics. Upon returning to Iran in 1964, he began teaching at the University of Mashhad. By 1966 he had established a center for interpretive Islamic teaching. It was not long before his lectures and books became immensely popular among the intellectual community and youths. His books were quickly sold out, despite the obstructive interference of the SAVAK. At the time, the clergy, as well as Islam, was unpopular to student populations of Iran. This was a result of a perspective viewing Islam as a religion of restrictions and submission. Shariati addresses this concern in one of his many writings. He says, "Islam has become the religion of 'no'. Don't do this. Don't do that. [Iran] needs a religion of 'yes'. A religion of empowerment and possibilities". Shariati interprets Islamic texts and presents it to the masses as a religion of possibilities and cooperations. His teachings had united much of the Iranian population under an interpretation of Islam that the clergy dismissed as blasphemy. Shariati teaches that Islam can be a religion of empowerment. His writings include, "the God of Islam is the God of science, revolution, freedom, responsibility, civilization, and human will. Each one of us is a representative of that God on earth". Ali Shariati's seductive interpretation of Islam became empowering for millions of Iranians across all socioeconomic statuses. As a result of his newly founded power, the Shah arrested him and closed his teaching institution in 1972. For three years, the people of Iran protested the government to issue his release. Finally, after a nationwide petition to issue his release, Shariati was transferred under house arrest in 1975. This was hardly freedom, for he was unable to release his writings as well as lecture. After two years under house arrest, the Shah permitted Shariati to travel to England. Shariati was martyred in London in 1977, only a week after his arrival. His death in June 1977, was under circumstances that his followers insist suggest the involvement of SAVAK. Although his writings were banned in Iran, his popularity grew stronger. Without a figure to follow, millions of intellectuals and youths turned their support for the group that Shariati advocated for the most: the Shi'a clergy. Prior to Shariati's teachings, the vast majority of intellectuals and youths were frustrated with the clergy, due to their perspective of the Islamic texts being restrictive of everyday life. Following Shariati's death however, millions of students and intellectuals protested for an Islamic government. Shariati's writings were revolutionary and provocative as he declares, "religion is not meant to either describe and analyze the characteristics of God or to teach what is dirty and what is clean and how to bathe or eat or drink. But, instead an ideology that would encourage and teach how to pick up arms and fight to put an end to exploitation and suppression". The exploitation and suppression is a reference to the Shah and his ties with the imperialistic West. The Mujahedin (MEK) group in Iran, led by intellectual Rajavi, strongly believed in Shariati's interpretations of Islam. When it came time for the fall of the Shah, much of the intelletuals and students in Iran believed that the Ayatollahs would enact the reforms that Shariati died voicing. Upon coming to power, one of the first acts of Khomeini, was to continue to ban on all of Shariati's writings. The interpretations made by Sharati were still considered blasphemy, and therefore illegal in an Islamic theocracy. Prior to 1979, without Shariati's persuasive interpretation of Islam, the students and intellectuals lacked any other reason to support the Ayatollah’s agenda for the future of Iran. Shariati’s mentor, and great French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre once said, “I have no religion. But if were to choose one, it would be Shariati's”. For this reason, Ali Shariati has been considered the most influential Iranian intellectual of the 20th century and the ideologue behind the revolution. <p>
               <p>  The Iranian Revolution of 1979 brought Iran into a new era of its sovereignty. On January 17th, 1979, the Shah fled the country due to growing violence. Two weeks later, on February 1st, Khomeini after almost 15 years in exile, returned to a roaring crowd of five million. The interim government of the time was Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar. Khomeini had appointed interim Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan, and within two weeks, the military had declared neutrality and the Bakhtiar regime collapsed. Upon realizing that much of Shariati's vision of Iran would be implemented by Khomeini, millions of students and intellectuals felt betrayed. The Iranian Hostage Crisis in October 1979, prevented Western interference during a sensitive time in the formation of the Islamic government. By the time the 52 hostages were released, Saddam Hussein in Iraq had launched a full scale military invasion of Iran's oil regions. The war, which lasted over eight years, turned millions of angered students into patriotic soldiers. The war strengthened the weakened country, and after successfully defending the sovereign territories of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini was viewed by the population as a hero. Massoud Rajavi, the leader of MEK, was released in 1979 following the Shah's eviction. MEK's agenda at the time now pursued establishing democracy in Iran. This clashed with Ayatollah' Khomeini's government. However, Massoud Rajavi had become too popular to arrest during the fragile state of the government. In January1980, the nation had its first presidential election. Rajavi had decided to run for president; however before the vote took place, Khomeini ordered his name to be omitted from the list. That same year, the Iranian Cultural Revolution, which lasted until 1987, had begun. The period marks the purge of Western and non-Islamic influence in Iranian education. Following the ban of many of Shariati's works, as well as other influential intellectuals, students and professors opposed Khomeini's vision for an Islamic theocracy. Throughout the purge, over 700 university professors were expelled along with thousands of students being denied admission. Between the years of 1980 and 1983, the Supreme Cultural Revolution Council closed the major universities in Iran. The intellectual community that initially supported the clergy and Khomeini as a result of Shariati's works, had been purged from Iran. With the war between Iraq threatening Iran's existence, many students barred from entering universities, became fighters in Iran's increasingly powerful military. The purges extended to all those who opposed the regime. To prevent this, Rajavi moved to Iraq with permission of Saddam Hussein and stationed the MEK in the country. Following the American Invasion of Iraq, he has disappeared and is currently considered "in hiding". The MEK renounced violence in 2001 and is now the main component organization of the National Council of Resistance of Iran. The Cultural Revolution and the Iran-Iraq War both contributed to the growth of stability in Iran following the revolution. After over 35 years of relative stability, the Islamic Republic of Iran has maintained its role as a regional power and is today rivaled by Saudi Arabia and Israel. <p>
                <p> Under the Shah's regime, many groups attempted to overthrow Reza Pahlavi. One of the most significant attempts, came from Ayatollah Khomeini in the early 1960s. His attempt, although it led to the death of the Prime Minister, failed largely due to lack of support from the intellectual community and the youths of the population. The group with similar goals, but contradicting ideologies that attempted to end the regime as well, were the Mujahedins led by scholar Massoud Rajavi. Rajavi, an intellectual, understood the significance of religion and the role it had in society. His attempt was suppressed by the Shah without much repercussions. Both attempts however, demonstrate that separately, neither religious nor intellectual provocation can lead to the collapse of the Shah. However, through Shariati's teaching and works, he advocated the support of the clergy which caused millions more to follow Ayatollah Khomeini, who had not done so 15 years prior. Shariati interpreted Islam in a manner that inspired intellectuals and students to begin their advocation for the clergy. Although religious Ayatollahs were predominantly responsible for the collapse of the Shah, their support came from secular intellectuals that advocated for their leadership. Within ten years, Ayatollah Khomeini was able to gain power from the intellectuals, establish an Islamic theocracy, purge such intellectuals, and successfully defend a nation against an eight year war. The cooperation of secular scholars and religious Ayatollahs during the Iranian Revolution was successful, suggesting that Iran was able to regain their cultural identity from Western Imperialism, as Shariati would have wanted. <p>
